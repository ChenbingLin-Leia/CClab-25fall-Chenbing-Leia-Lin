                <p>As Doctor Silas Vex sought ingredients for his seventeenth cave expedition, he discovered the phantom guardian. An entire pack of guardians, in fact. Sworn to defend the treasure within, they raked him with rays. Yet, Silas shattered them with gunfire, claimed the mysterious crystal that drove them, and rewired the last surviving guardian—enslaving it as the sole security for his laboratory...</p>

                <p>It bore a wolf-like visage with a crystalline sheen, pulsing with a faint light in the shadows. Its expression was so frigid that one felt plunged into an icy cavern, even in the height of summer.</p>

                During his lifetime, Silas Vex never revealed the Guardian's existence to the outside world. He only confided in his notes with the following entry:

January 3, 1990. William Island cavern. Discovered several crystalline statues—forms of a bird, a goat, a lion, a chimera—encircling a treasure chest. The statues attack with rays, provoke geysers of blood, and conjure a crimson rain. They are susceptible to standard pistol fire. No other mechanisms detected within the cavern. One wolf-liked statue is malfunctioning and currently non-hostile. Arranging for its transport and study.

After Silas's death, examination of his manuscripts led investigators to his secret mausoleum laboratory, where they first encountered the creature. Carbon-14 dating of the stone pedestal upon which the Guardian stood placed its creation around 2000 BC, hinting at the immense antiquity of the Guardian itself.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> In the aftermath of the confrontation, our dear friend Silas had, with precise ballistics, thoroughly neutralized the Phantom Guardian's threat. Though it retains its ability to conjure the crimson rain, the creature is now rendered harmless to humankind.

Furthermore, in his grand research, Silas discovered a substance that reacts with the guardian's rays, coalescing into beautiful crystalline pillars. Now, one need only use this new technology to press and drag the faintly glowing orbs suspended in the void. This action activates the guardian, compelling it to fire its rays, summon the blood rain, and battle imagined foes in the direction of the orb's manipulation—all while humanity sits back and reaps the rewards.

Once a sufficient number of crystals have been collected, a single key press purges the guardian's enslaved memories, resetting it for flawless service, utterly erasing all prior traces. That said, owing to a peculiar proclivity of our old friend Vex, each time we restart the program and quietly admire the falling crimson, a counter etches itself into the void—a silent testament to the number of times we have enthralled it.
